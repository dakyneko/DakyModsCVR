This repository contains my mods for CVR (Chillout VR). Join the [CVR Modding Group discord](https://discord.gg/gbvQpNhB) for support and more mods!

# Installation

Requirements:
- [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader#how-to-use-the-installer)

Then download the .dll mods you want [from here in the release section](https://github.com/dakyneko/DakyModsCVR/releases) which you must place into your `Mods` folder of your game directory (check Steam installation directory).

**Warning**: Mods are provided as is and there is no guarantee of working.

**Building** instructions found below. Developpers, please read ;)

# Mods

## Action Menu
Add a new popup menu to quickly control your avatar and game settings with just a few tap of your joystick. Once installed, to open it in VR, you have to assign a new binding in SteamVR controller; for desktop press e key. [Please read the following, for more information. How to use it, how to customize and mod it](ActionMenu/README.md).

## Lag Free Screenshots
Add many features and prevent lag when you take screenshots. Pick the resolution up to 16K and the format: JPG, PNG or WebP (and the compression quality); Portrait pictures are automatically rotated like your smartphone does. Optionally you can embed metadata EXIF/ITxT like world info and player list.

Note: This is a [knah mod Lag Free Screenshot](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods) ported from VRC and improved in the version here. Credit to knah for the great work!

### WebP supports

Optionnally you can install some .dll dependency to have directly screenshots saved as .webp. Copy the 3 libwebp\*.dll files found at the root of this project into your game directory (next to ChilloutVR.exe).

For developpers: libwebp and libwebmux are built from the original sources. The libwebpwrapper is my patched version of the C# libwebp wrapper, source here <https://github.com/dakyneko/WebP-wrapper>.

## Camera★Remote

Allows you to control the camera with one hand. It will fly smoothly like a virtual joystick in your hand. It's way more intuitive and cinematic style than the drone mode. To use it, click the new button 'Remote Control' under the camera.

## Camera★Instants

Spawn your photo in-game just after you take it. Mimicking old polaroid cameras which printed the picture instantly.

## Camera★

Add new buttons and settings for the camera. So far:

- Lock your camera (no more unintended grab)
- Real alpha transparency (unlike the green 'mask')
- New settings: near/far plane, hide world

## NoIntro

Always skip Chillout intro when game starts, roughly take 10 seconds.

## Building
To build yourself:

 - (1) Ensure to compile with .net sdk 7 or lower (current ILRepack is not compatible with .net sdk 8 and above)
 - (2) Install NStrip.exe from https://github.com/BepInEx/NStrip into this directory (or into your PATH). This tools converts all assembly symbols to public ones. Make life easy!
 - (3) Create a new Windows environnment variable `%CVRPATH%` which should point to your game path (folder where `ChilloutVR.exe` resides). In Windows, look for Settings > Advanced system settings > Advanced > Environment Variables, add a new one there, it should point to something like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ChilloutVR` or similar.
 - (4) Run `copy_and_nstrip_dll.bat` this will copy the game + MelonLoader .dll into this project and run NStrip.exe to make them public (easier developers).

Use Visual Studio 2019 or your IDE of choice to build. Enjoy. Feel free to join the the Discord server for support (in case of errors or questions). Thanks.
